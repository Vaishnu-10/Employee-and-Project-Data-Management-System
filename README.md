Employee and Project Data Management System

 Project Overview

This project, titled Employee and Project Data Management System, demonstrates the creation and execution of SQL queries to manage and analyze data from two tables: `EmployeeDetail` and `ProjectDetail`. It showcases a variety of SQL concepts including data retrieval, string and date manipulation, filtering, aggregation, and joining tables.

 Entities Involved

1. EmployeeDetail
   - Columns: FirstName, LastName, Gender, Department, Salary, JoiningDate
   - Contains detailed information about employees.

2. ProjectDetail
   - Columns: ProjectName, EmployeeID
   - Contains details about projects and their assigned employees.

 SQL Concepts Demonstrated

 Data Retrieval and Manipulation

- Basic Select Queries:
  - Extract all details from the `EmployeeDetail` table.
  - Retrieve specific columns like `FirstName`.

- String Manipulation:
  - Convert `FirstName` to uppercase.
  - Combine `FirstName` and `LastName` as "Name".
  - Trim white spaces from `FirstName`.
  - Prefix `FirstName` with "Hello".

- Filtering Records:
  - Select employees based on specific criteria, such as name patterns.
  - Filter employees by salary range.

- Date Handling:
  - Format dates in different styles.
  - Extract parts of dates (year, month, time).
  - Calculate date differences in months and days.
  - Retrieve system and UTC dates.

 Aggregation and Grouping

- Aggregate Functions:
  - Find the highest and lowest salaries.
  - Sum, average, and count salaries by department.

- Grouping Data:
  - Group employee records by department and calculate aggregate values.

 Joining Tables

- Inner and Outer Joins:
  - Join `EmployeeDetail` and `ProjectDetail` to retrieve related records.
  - Handle cases with unmatched records.

- Advanced Joins:
  - Perform cross joins.
  - Identify employees with multiple projects and projects with multiple employees.
  - Display project details even without matching employee IDs.

 Additional Queries

- Retrieve unique departments.
- Count employees.
- Filter and display specific names.
- Abbreviate gender as M/F.
- Filter employees by salary criteria.

 Summary

This project highlights the following SQL skills:

- Data Retrieval: Proficient in extracting specific data.
- String and Date Manipulation: Transforming and formatting data.
- Filtering and Pattern Matching: Applying filters and using wildcard characters.
- Aggregation and Grouping: Computing and summarizing aggregate values.
- Table Joins: Performing inner, outer, and cross joins.
- Advanced Querying: Handling complex queries with multiple conditions.

The Employee and Project Data Management System project demonstrates comprehensive SQL capabilities, making it a valuable asset for data management and analysis tasks.
